In my efforts of being cool I put a hashtag in my headline. Is that not what people do nowadays?

Anyways. My name is Gina and I have been a server, bartender and manager in the restaurant industry for my whole work life. I am in my mid twenties now and have not attended a college. Is it really worth all the hype and money? I think not!    
Let me tell you how this web development thing all started! I had a fairly bad cold a couple of months ago that put me in my bed for about a week. With nothing else to do but think,  I contemplated my life choices - as you just do when you get ill. I realized that what I am doing is not going to get me anywhere and whilst I was trying to teach myself some coding on the side, it never got me very far. I have goals! I want to own a house with chickens and goats and lots of dogs. How can I achieve that and also take care of all those animals, you ask? By working remotely as a web developer of course! Even though that is my main drive for doing a full time program on it, I am also learning to love coding along the way. How nice is it to use my brain again! And everything is so straight forward and I can create whatever I want - at least eventually I will. Not quite there yet. It is so refreshing and different and new and so so so enjoyable. I never in a million years would have guessed that I would be into coding, but here I am. 

Onto the next struggle, ready to conquer!
