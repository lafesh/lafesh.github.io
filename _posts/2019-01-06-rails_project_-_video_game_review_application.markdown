For this month's project I decided to create an application where you can find reviews for video games and when signed in can write your own reviews as well. If a game does not exist yet, a user can create that as well. 
While building this app, I realized that I have the biggest issue with trying to figure out code that I have not written. For the signup, login, logout, etc. process I decided to use a gem called devise. Though now it is working just fine, I was struggling with figuring its details out. I had issues with the initial setup and having custom params. The omniauth also had its hurdles. After extensive research and lots of trial and error, I figured it out eventually. Levels of frustration were definitely very high. When I write my own code, I know where everything is and why it has been written. With a gem like this there is just so many files, all structured differently than I am used to. It takes some getting used to. I will try to implement new gems as much as possible in the future to get more used to figuring those things out. 
The rest of the application was fairly easy to build. Though keeping track of all the routes without getting lost was a constant holdup for me. In addition to that, trying to keep my code as DRY as possible was constantly on my mind. Though trying my best to do so, I still think there can be a lot of improvement. There are parts where I know this can be written better but unfortunately, I do not have an easier alternative readily available. Constant repetition and communication with other people will certainly help me with that and I am sure my code will get dryer over time without me even noticing it.
